# Problem Statement:
A retail company “ABC Private Limited” wants to understand the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories. They have shared purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products from last month.
The data set also contains customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, city_type, stay_in_current_city), product details (product_id and product category) and Total purchase_amount from last month.

Now, they want to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customer against various products which will help them to create personalized offer for customers against different products.

Approach:
Preprocessing the dataset:
1) Handle Missing Values
2) Feature Engineering - Product category column was engineered to create another column to cover the data aspects of Product Category 1, Product Category 2, Product Category 3
3) Scaling the continous data
4) Applying the ML algorithm to the dataset:
  1) Linear Regression
  2) Decision Trees
